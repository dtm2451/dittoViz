# dittoViz

A data.frame focues version of dittoSeq.  Not fully functional yet, and not even a full package in a lot of senses.  Read: Early.

## Scope

The goal is for this package to encompass as much functionality from dittoSeq as makes sense when targeting data stored in a data.frame-type object instead of a Seurat/SingleCellExperiemnt/SummarizedExperiment object. 

Additionally, this package will have a similarly named, largely equivalent, python companion which would target `pandas.DataFrame`s using similar syntax.  (Similarity level is a question, due to divergent constraints on the R vs. python versions, but the priority is there.)
