Description: A comprehensive visualization toolkit built with coders of any
    level and color-blind audiences in mind that allows highly customizable
    creation of color blindness friendly, publication-quality figures. Spawned
    out of the scRNAseq-focused dittoSeq-package, this package contains all of
    it's visualization machinery with none of the added (sc)RNAseq-related
    dependency requirements. Visualizations include scatterplots, compositional
    bar plots, violin, box, and ridge plots, and more. Customizations range from
    size and title adjustments to automatic generation of annotations for
    heatmaps, hidden data overlay upon cursor hovering via ggplotly conversion,
    and many more. All with simple, discrete inputs. Color blindness
    friendliness is powered by legend adjustments (enlarged keys), and by
    allowing the use of shapes or letter-overlay in addition to the carefully
    selected dittoColors.
